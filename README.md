# Operation Lifeblood – Prototype Site

This folder contains a single-page prototype website for Operation Lifeblood.

## Files

- `index.html` – The one-page site (uses Tailwind via CDN).
- `OPERATION_LIFEBLOOD_LOGO_1.png` – Place your logo file with this exact name alongside `index.html`.

## How to use with GitHub Pages

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub, e.g. `operation-lifeblood-site`.
2. Upload these files (`index.html` and your `OPERATION_LIFEBLOOD_LOGO_1.png` logo) to the root of the repo.
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, choose:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save. After a short delay, GitHub Pages will provide a live URL with your site.

Edit `index.html` to adjust content, then commit and push to update the live site.
